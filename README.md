## Overview

NextTrace Web is a spin-off of the [NextTrace](https://github.com/nxtrace/NTrace-core) project. It provides a simple web frontend and API server so you can run traceroutes and visualize results — including hop, IP, ASN, geolocation, domain, packet loss, and latency stats — entirely from your browser.

> **Reverse proxy note:** This project uses WebSocket as its communication protocol. If you configure a reverse proxy, please refer to the Nginx config included in this repository. The provided Docker image already has Nginx reverse proxy built in.

*Inspired by [PING.PE](https://ping.pe) — thanks for years of keeping that service alive and giving the community such a great reference.*

## Interface Theme

This fork restyles the frontend with a neutral dark theme. Only the presentation layer changed: `assets/css/m.css` and the heatmap color ramps in `assets/js/mtr-agg.js`. No DOM ids, i18n keys, English/Chinese copy, or table markup were touched, so the upstream test suite still passes unmodified.

| | Upstream | This fork |
|---|---|---|
| Page background | `#030704` (dark green) | `#0e1117` (neutral dark blue-grey) |
| Accent | `#4fdd73` (fluorescent green) | `#4d9ef7` (blue) |
| Table header | green gradient bar | flat `#1a2230` |
| Latency heatmap | pure red channel ramp | teal → amber → brick ramp |
| Card treatment | translucent + blur + heavy shadow | solid surface + hairline border |

The heatmap ramps are sampled continuously rather than clamped per-channel, so the gradient stays smooth across the whole latency range. Numeric columns are right-aligned with tabular figures, and a fixed light foreground color is applied to those cells so the inline background stays legible at every step of the ramp.

## How To Use

### Docker (Recommended)

```bash
docker pull tsosc/nexttraceweb
docker run --network host -d --privileged --name ntwa tsosc/nexttraceweb 127.0.0.1:30080
# Visit http://127.0.0.1:30080
```

Expose the service to the Internet through your own reverse proxy or gateway. This project does not ship an in-app login flow.

### Custom Address & Port

Pass an address/port argument to `docker run` to override the default:

```bash
# Bind to localhost only
docker run --network host -d --privileged --name ntwa tsosc/nexttraceweb 127.0.0.1:30080

# Listen on all IPs, port 80
docker run --network host -d --privileged --name ntwa tsosc/nexttraceweb 80

# Listen on IPv6 loopback
docker run --network host -d --privileged --name ntwa tsosc/nexttraceweb [::1]:30080
```

## Interface Language

The UI ships English and Simplified Chinese. The selector in the page header defaults to **Auto**, which follows the browser's `Accept-Language` preference; pick `English` or `中文` to pin one. The choice is stored in `localStorage` under `uiLanguage`.

The separate **Geo Data Language** option inside the settings drawer is unrelated — it is passed straight to `nexttrace` and controls the language of geolocation data, not the interface.

## Sub-path Deployment

All assets, the `/api/devices` endpoint, and the Socket.IO path are resolved relative to the page's own directory, so the app can be mounted under a sub-path. The outer proxy must **strip the prefix** (note the trailing slash on both `location` and `proxy_pass`) and redirect the prefix without a trailing slash:

```nginx
# In the http block. $connection_upgrade is not a built-in variable:
map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
    default upgrade;
    ''      close;
}

# In the server block. https://example.com/tools/nexttrace/ maps to the container root:
location = /tools/nexttrace {
    return 301 /tools/nexttrace/$is_args$args;
}

location /tools/nexttrace/ {
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:30080/;
}
```

Both trailing slashes matter. Drop the one on `proxy_pass` and the backend receives `/tools/nexttrace/...`, for which it has no route. The 301 covers visitors who leave the trailing slash out of the address bar: the browser resolves relative references against the parent directory, so the assets would be fetched from `/tools/assets/...` and the page would render unstyled.

## Runtime Notes

- Health endpoint: `GET /healthz`
- The container now exits when `gunicorn` or `nginx` dies, so supervisors can restart it instead of leaving a half-dead process tree behind.
- `nexttrace_error` is now a structured payload with `code` and `message`, plus `retry_after_seconds` on rate-limit and capacity rejections.

## Security Defaults

- Configure `NTWA_SECRET_KEY` in production. If omitted, the app generates a temporary random key and logs a warning.
- Recommended: set `NTWA_TRUSTED_HOSTS=trace.example.com` behind a reverse proxy.
- Set `NTWA_SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=true` only when the outer proxy serves HTTPS.
- Abuse controls:
  - `NTWA_MIN_START_INTERVAL_SECONDS`
  - `NTWA_MAX_ACTIVE_TRACES`
  - `NTWA_TRACE_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`
  - `NTWA_TRACE_MAX_DURATION_SECONDS`

## External Auth Example

Minimal Nginx example with Basic Auth in front of the container:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name trace.example.com;

    auth_basic "restricted";
    auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/.htpasswd;

    location / {
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:30080;
    }
}
```
